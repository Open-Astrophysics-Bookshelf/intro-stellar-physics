\section{Introduction: Our Sun}

Let's start by considering the star we know best: the sun\sidenote{The symbol $\sun$ is used to denote the sun}. Measurements of the Earth-Sun distance and hence the size of the sun began in antiquity\sidenote{See \citet{Weinberg2015To-Explain-the-} for a physicist's perspective on how this was done.}. Observations of the planets' orbital periods, when combined with Kepler's laws, determine the planets' relative distances from the sun. The distance scale is then fixed using radar ranging of objects in the solar system, with the mean Earth-Sun distance, known as an \newterm{astronomical unit}, being defined\cite{Luzum2011The-IAU-2009-sy} as
\[
	\val{1}{\AU} = \val{\sci{1.495\,978\,707\,00}{11}}{\meter}.
\]
From the sizes and periods of the planetary orbits, along with Newton's theory of gravity, we deduce the mass of the sun\sidenote{Note that $G\Msun$ is known much more precisely than $G$ or $\Msun$ separately.}:
\[
	\Msun = \val{\sci{1.99}{30}}{\kilo\gram}.
\]
The sun is roughly $10^{6}$ times more massive than the Earth and 1\,000 times more massive than Jupiter. Knowing the Earth-Sun distance and the angular size of the sun, about $0.5^{\circ}$ across its diameter, gives us its radius:
\[
	\Rsun = \val{\sci{6.96}{8}}{\meter}.
\]
The total radiant power emitted by a star is its
\newterm{luminosity} $L$. A detector with a collecting area $\mathcal{A}$ located a distance $d$ from a star intercepts a fraction $\mathcal{A}/(4\pi d^{2})$ of the star's light.  We call $F = L/(4\pi d^{2})$ the \newterm{flux}, which has units $\watt\,\meter^{-2}$. From the mean solar flux\cite{Kopp2011A-new-lower-val} at \val{1}{\AU}, $\val{1360.8\pm0.5}{\watt\usk\meter^{-2}}$, we the infer the sun's luminosity:
\[
	\Lsun = \val{\sci{3.83}{26}}{\watt}.
\]

\begin{exercisebox}[Solar power]
Suppose we wish to replace the MSU power plant---rated at $\val{70}{\Mega\watt}$ ($\val{\sci{70}{6}}{\watt}$)---with a grid of solar panels. Under ideal conditions (direct light and 100\% efficient panels), how many square meters of solar panels are needed?
\end{exercisebox}

\begin{exercisebox}[Flux from a distant star]
What would the flux be from a star with $L = \val{0.1}{\Lsun}$ at a distance of $\val{10}{\parsec}$?
Recall that a parsec (pc) is defined by the relation
\[
	\frac{\val{1}{\AU}}{\val{1}{\parsec}} = 1'' = \frac{1}{206\,265}.
\]
\end{exercisebox}

Our information about the sun and the more distant stars is carried by light. Before going further, then, let's establish some basic properties of light and how observations are made.

\section{Intensity and specific flux}
\label{s.intensity-specific-flux}

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{E-B-free-space}
\caption[The electric force in a light wave]{Schematic of the electric field (blue arrows) and magnetic field (red arrows) for a wave traveling along direction $\bvec{k}$ with wavelength $\lambda$.}
\label{f.light-wave}
\end{marginfigure}
When we detect light, what happens at the atomic level is that the charges in our detector (a CCD, an eye, a photographic emulsion) feel an electric (and magnetic) force that oscillates with frequency $\nu$. Imagine setting up a grid of detectors that measure the electric and magnetic forces per charge at each point in space and at each instant of time. We call these forces per charge the electric and magnetic fields, $\bvec{E}(\bvec{x},t)$ and $\bvec{B}(\bvec{x},t)$. As light passes through this grid, we would notice a sinusoidal pattern, with amplitude proportional to $|\bvec{E}|^{2} + |\bvec{B}|^{2}$, traveling at speed\sidenote{This velocity is exact; the meter is defined in terms of the speed of light.} $c = \val{299\,792\,458}{\meter/\second}$ with a wavelength $\lambda = c/\nu$.

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{intensity}
\caption{\label{f.intensity} Schematic of radiative intensity}
\end{marginfigure}
Take a detector and place (see Fig.~\ref{f.intensity}) in front of the detector a filter that only lets through light with wavelengths in a range $\Delta\lambda$. Place a mask over the detector with a small pinhole of area $\Delta A$ that restricts the light falling on the detector to fall in a narrow cone of solid angle $\Delta\Omega$ about the normal to the detector. Then measure the energy $\Delta E$ incident on the detector in a time $\Delta t$. The quantity
\begin{equation}\label{e.definition-intensity}
I_{\lambda} \equiv \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t\,\Delta A\,\Delta\lambda\,\Delta\Omega}
\end{equation}
is known as the \newterm{intensity}, and is the basic quantity describing radiation. At sufficiently low intensity, we would find that energy is deposited into our detector in discrete quanta, known as \newterm{photons}, with each photon having an energy $hc/\lambda = h\nu$\marginnote{The symbol $h = \val{\sci{6.63}{-34}}{\unitstyle{J}\usk\second}$ denotes \newterm{Planck's constant}.}. The light emitted by the sun (or any other source) consists of a huge number of photons distributed over a broad range of wavelengths, known as a \newterm{spectrum}. The intensity describes how the photons are distributed in energy and momentum.

\begin{exercisebox}[Photon flux from the sun]
The peak of the sun's spectrum is at a wavelength of approximately $\val{500}{\nano\meter}$. Estimate the number of photons from the sun striking $\val{1}{\meter^{2}}$ of Earth each second.
\end{exercisebox}

In situations in which the wavelength is small (relative to the system in question so we can neglect diffraction), light propagates along \newterm{rays}. By a ray of light, we mean the light emitted into a small cone of opening solid angle $\dif\Omega$ about a direction $\unitk$. In the absence of any interactions with matter, the intensity is conserved along a ray if both source and receiver are stationary with respect to one another (Exercise~\ref{ex.intensity-conserved}).

\begin{sidebar}[Solid angles]
\label{sb.solid-angles}
Imagine that your are at the center of a great sphere of radius $R$, and you shine a light that emits rays into some solid angle. Orient your coordinates so that the rays are traveling along the $z$-axis. The light will illuminate an area
\[ 	A = R^{2}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\theta}\sin\theta\,\dif\theta\,\dif\phi. \]
Here $\theta$ is the opening half-angle of the cone. The solid angle into which the light is emitted is $\Omega = A/R^{2}$. Astronomers often express the integral by changing variables to $\mu = \cos\theta$, so that the solid angle is
\[
	\Delta\Omega = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{1-\Delta\mu}^{1}\dif\mu\,\dif\phi.
\]
If we integrate over all angles ($0\le\theta\le\pi$, or $-1\le\mu\le 1$), then we get the area of a sphere, $A = 4\pi R^{2}$.
\end{sidebar}

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{intensity-conserved}
\caption[Schematic of intensity being constant]{\label{f.intensity-conserved} Schematic for exercise \ref{ex.intensity-conserved}.}
\end{marginfigure}
\begin{exercisebox}[Proof that $I_{\lambda}$ is conserved]
\label{ex.intensity-conserved}
Your friend (at top in Fig.~\ref{f.intensity-conserved}) flashes a light: in a time $\Delta t$ it emits energy $\Delta E_{\mathrm{emit}}$ in a waveband $\Delta\lambda$. The opening through which the light passes has area $\Delta A_{\mathrm{emit}}$, and the light goes into a cone of opening solid angle $\Delta\Omega_{\mathrm{emit}}$. Your friend therefore calculates her intensity as
\[	
	I_{\lambda,\mathrm{emit}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\mathrm{emit}}}{\Delta t\,\Delta A_{\mathrm{emit}}\,\Delta\lambda \,\Delta\Omega_{\mathrm{emit}}}.
\]
You stand (at bottom in Fig.~\ref{f.intensity-conserved}) a distance $d$ ($d^{2}\gg \Delta A_{\mathrm{emit}}, \Delta A_{\mathrm{obs}}$) from your friend with a camera. The aperture on your camera has area $\Delta A_{\mathrm{obs.}}$. Show that the intensity you receive is $I_{\lambda,\mathrm{obs}} = I_{\lambda,\mathrm{emit}}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate the incident energy that falls on your camera aperture $\Delta E_{\mathrm{obs}}$.
\item What solid angle $\Delta\Omega_{\mathrm{obs}}$ is subtended by the rays entering the aperture?
\item Now compute your intensity
\[	
	I_{\lambda,\mathrm{obs}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\mathrm{obs}}}{\Delta t\,\Delta A_{\mathrm{obs}}\,\Delta\lambda \,\Delta\Omega_{\mathrm{obs}}}.
\]
and show that this is the same as what your friend calculated.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercisebox}

A related quantity is the \newterm{specific flux} $F_{\lambda}$, which is the energy carried by light having wavelength in a range $\Delta\lambda$ crossing an area $\Delta A$ (from all angles) in a time $\Delta t$. We compute $F_{\lambda}$ by multiplying the intensity by $\cos\theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the ray and the normal of our area\sidenote{this gives the projected area} and integrating over angle:
\begin{equation}\label{e.specific-flux}
F_{\lambda} =  \int I_{\lambda}\,\cos\theta\,\sin\theta\,\dif\theta\,\dif\phi.
\end{equation}

\section{Thermal emission}
\label{s.thermal-emission}

Imagine we had a material that emits and absorbs equally well at all wavelengths. We then made from this material a hollow box, and we heated this box to a temperature $T$. The hot atoms in the walls of the box would emit (and absorb) photons bouncing around in the cavity in this box, until the photons were in thermal equilibrium\sidenote{Meaning that the radiation field is on average neither gaining or losing energy from the walls of the box} with the walls of the box. If we then drilled a small hole in the side of the box, some photons would escape (but not so many as to disturb the thermal equilibrium). The intensity emerging from such a box is known as the \newterm{Planck spectrum}:
\begin{equation}\label{e.planck-spectrum-wavelength}
I_{\lambda}(\mathrm{Planck}) \equiv B_{\lambda}(T) = \frac{2hc^{2}}{\lambda^{5}} \left[\exp\left(\frac{hc}{\lambda\kB T}\right)-1\right]^{-1}.
\end{equation}
Here $\kB = \val{\sci{1.381}{-23}}{\unitstyle{J}\usk\K^{-1}}$ denotes \newterm{Boltzmann's constant}. This spectrum is also known as a \newterm{blackbody} spectrum, because it is emitted from a material that absorbs (and therefore emits) equally well at all wavelengths. The emission is peaked at a wavelength $\lambda_{\mathrm{pk}} \sim hc/\kB T$. 
Fig.~\ref{f.Planck} displays Planck's spectra for various temperatures. Note that $B_{\lambda}$ increases at all wavelengths as the temperature increases.
\begin{marginfigure}[-12\baselineskip]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Planck}
\caption[Thermal spectra]{\label{f.Planck}Thermal spectra for temperatures ranging from \val{3000}{\K} to \val{7000}{\K}.}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{exercisebox}[Peak of thermal spectrum \notebook]\label{ex.Wien-wavelength}
Show that the peak of the thermal spectrum, temperature $T$, occurs (i.e., where $B_{\lambda}$ is maximum) at a wavelength
\[ \lambda_{\mathrm{pk}} = \val{290}{\nano\meter}\left(\frac{\val{10\,000}{\K}}{T}\right). \]
This result is known as \newterm{Wien's law}. Check this: what is the peak wavelength of the sun's emission? What is the peak wavelength for the cosmic microwave background ($T_{\mathrm{CMB}} = \val{2.73}{\K}$)? \notebook~\emph{Hint:} In finding the peak, you may need to find the root of a function numerically; that is, you will have an expression $f(x)$ and you want to find $x_{r}$ such that $f(x=x_{r}) = 0$. There are multiple ways to do this; see the notebooks \code{bisection} and \code{brent} in the \code{numerical-methods/notebooks} folder.
\end{exercisebox}

The Planck spectrum, expressed in terms of frequency, is
\begin{equation}\label{e.planck-spectrum-frequency}
B_{\nu}(T) = \frac{2h\nu^{3}}{c^{2}} \left[\exp\left(\frac{h\nu}{\kB T}\right)-1\right]^{-1}.
\end{equation}

\begin{exercisebox}[Frequency peak in thermal spectrum \notebook]
What is the frequency corresponding to $\lambda_{\mathrm{pk}}$ in Exercise~\ref{ex.Wien-wavelength}? \notebook~Compute the frequency $\nu_{\mathrm{pk}}$ at which $B_{\nu}$ is maximum. Is $\nu_{\mathrm{pk}}$ the same as the frequency corresponding to $\lambda_{\mathrm{pk}}$?
\end{exercisebox}

Using Eq.~(\ref{e.specific-flux}), we can compute the specific flux of this thermal radiation. Since $B_{\lambda}$ doesn't depend on angle, the integral is easy:
\[ F_{\lambda} = B_{\lambda}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}\cos\theta\,\sin\theta\,\dif\theta\,\dif\phi = 0. \]

\begin{exercisebox}[No net flux for thermal emission]
Explain, without using mathematical expressions, why there is no net flux for thermal emission.
\end{exercisebox}

Although the net flux is zero, if we just want the radiation escaping from our cavity, we should only integrate over the angles $0\le\theta\le\pi/2$. If we do this, then our \emph{outward-going} specific flux is
\begin{equation}\label{e.outward-thermal-flux}
 F_{\lambda}(\mathrm{outward}) = B_{\lambda}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\cos\theta\,\sin\theta\,\dif\theta\,\dif\phi = \pi B_{\lambda}.
\end{equation}
To find the total power emitted per area for thermal radiation, we need to integrate $F_{\lambda}$ over wavelength:
\begin{equation}\label{e.bolometric-thermal-flux}
F = \int_{0}^{\infty}F_{\lambda}(\mathrm{outward})\,\dif\lambda 
	= \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{2\pi hc^{2}}{\lambda^{5}} \frac{\dif\lambda}{\exp\left(hc/\lambda\kB T\right)-1}.
\end{equation}
By changing variables to $x = hc/\lambda\kB T$, we can write this integral as\marginnote{The integral over $x$ can be converted into $3!\,\zeta(4)$, where $\zeta$ is the Riemann zeta function; for further information, consult a text on mathematical methods in physics.}
\[
	F = \frac{2\pi\kB^{4}}{h^{2}c}T^{4}\times \underbrace{\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{3}}{e^{x}-1}\,\dif x}_{=\pi^{4}/15} = \left[\frac{2\pi^{5}}{15}\frac{\kB^{4}}{h^{2}c}\right] T^{4}.
\]
The quantity in $\left[\cdot\right]$ is called the \newterm{Stefan-Boltzmann constant}:
\[
	\sigmaSB = \val{\sci{5.7}{-8}}{\watt\usk\meter^{-2}\usk\K^{-4}};
\]
The total energy radiated per second per area from a thermal emitter of temperature $T$ is thus $\sigmaSB T^{4}$.

\newthought{Real stars are \emph{not} blackbodies!} That being said, their spectra are roughly thermal, so we can define an \newterm{effective surface temperature}
\[	\Teff = \left[\frac{F}{\sigmaSB}\right]^{1/4}. \]
The total power output, or \emph{luminosity}, of a star of radius $R$ is thus
\begin{equation}\label{e.total-luminosity}
	L = 4\pi R^{2}\sigmaSB \Teff^{4}.
\end{equation}
For the sun, $\Teff = \val{5780}{\K}$.

\section{The radiation energy density}\label{s.radiation-energy-density}

We introduced
\[
I_{\lambda} \equiv \frac{\dif E}{\dif t\,\dif A\,\dif\lambda\,\dif\Omega}
\]
as the radiant energy $\dif E$ crossing an area $\dif A$ in a time $\dif t$, directed into a solid angle $\dif\Omega$, and carried by photons with wavelengths in a range $\dif\lambda$. Notice that in time $\dif t$, these photons will fill a volume $\dif V = c\dif t\times \dif A$. Hence we can write the intensity as
\[
I_{\lambda} = c\frac{\dif E}{\dif V\,\dif \lambda\,\dif\Omega}.
\]
Using this expressions, we define the radiant energy density per wavelength as
\begin{equation}
	U_{\lambda} \equiv \frac{\dif E}{\dif V\,\dif\lambda} = \frac{1}{c}\int I_{\lambda}\,\dif \Omega.
\end{equation}
If the radiation is thermal, that is, if $I_{\lambda} = B_{\lambda}$, then
\[
U_{\lambda} = \frac{B_{\lambda}}{c}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}\sin\theta\,\dif\theta\,\dif\phi = \frac{4\pi}{c}B_{\lambda},
\]
and the total radiant energy density is
\[
U = \int_{0}^{\infty}U_{\lambda}\,\dif\lambda = \frac{4}{c}\pi\int_{0}^{\infty}B_{\lambda}\,\dif\lambda = \left[\frac{4\sigmaSB}{c}\right] T^{4}.
\]
In this expression, 
\[ 
a = \left[\frac{4\sigmaSB}{c}\right] = \val{\sci{7.566}{-16}}{\unitstyle{J}\usk\meter^{-3}\usk\K^{-4}}.
\]
and we have used equations~(\ref{e.outward-thermal-flux}) and (\ref{e.bolometric-thermal-flux}). The energy density of thermal radiation is $U = aT^{4}$.

It is common to denote the average (over angle) intensity as
\begin{equation}\label{e.angle-average-intensity}
J_{\lambda} = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int I_{\lambda}\,\dif\Omega;
\end{equation}
the specific energy density is thus
\[ U_{\lambda} = \frac{4\pi}{c}J_{\lambda}. \]

\begin{sidebar}[Momentum transport and radiation pressure]
\label{sb.radiation-pressure}
In addition to transporting energy, photon also carry momentum. You will learn in your quantum mechanics course that the momentum of a photon of energy $h\nu$ traveling along direction $\unitk$ is
\[ \bvec{p} = \frac{h\nu}{c}\unitk = \frac{h}{\lambda}\unitk. \]
Here $\nu$ and $\lambda = c/\nu$ are the frequency and wavelength of the photon. Hence the momentum carried by photons of energy $E_{\nu}$ along direction $\unitk$ is $E/c$. Since $I_{\nu}$ is the amount of energy carried by photons per area per time along the direction $\unitk$, the momentum transported by those photons per area per time along direction $\unitk$ must be $(I_{\nu}/c)\unitk$.

\newthought{To relate this momentum transport to the radiation pressure,} suppose we have a sheet of absorbing material with a normal $\unitn$ being impinged by a ray of photon traveling along $\unitk$. As the photons are absorbed, they transfer momentum (along direction $\unitn$) of $(E_{\nu}/c)\unitn\vdot\unitk$ to the matter. The projected area of the ray on the matter is $\dif A\,\unitn\vdot\unitk$. The rate of momentum transfer along $\unitn$ per area per frequency is therefore
\begin{eqnarray}
P_{\!\nu} &=& \frac{1}{c}\int I_{\nu}
	{\color{red}\underbrace{\left(\unitn\vdot\unitk\right)}_{\textrm{proj.~area}}}
	{\color{blue}\underbrace{\left(\unitn\vdot\unitk\right)}_{\textrm{comp.\ of $\bvec{p}$ along $\unitn$}}}
	\,\dif\Omega \nonumber\\
	&=& \frac{1}{c}\int_{0}^{2\phi}\int_{-1}^{1}I_{\nu} \mu^{2}\,\dif \mu\,\dif\phi.
\label{e.momentum-transfer}
\end{eqnarray}
A change in momentum per time is a force; hence equation~(\ref{e.momentum-transfer}) represents the force per area, or \newterm{pressure}, exerted by photons with frequencies in $[\nu,\nu+\dif\nu]$. The two factors of $\mu=\cos\theta$ account for the projected area and the component of momentum along the normal to the surface $\unitn$.

If the radiation is thermal, so that $I_{\nu} = B_{\nu}$ and is independent of angle, then
\[
	P_{\!\nu} = \frac{4\pi}{3c}B_{\nu}.
\]
We can integrate $P_{\!\nu}$ over frequency to get the total radiation pressure,
\begin{equation}\label{e.radiation-pressure}
	\Prad = \frac{4\pi}{3c}\int_{0}^{\infty}B_{\nu}\,\dif\nu = \frac{4}{3c}\sigmaSB T^{4} = \frac{1}{3}aT^{4}.
\end{equation}
Note that the pressure is $1/3$ of the energy density for thermal radiation. This is in general true for a gas of relativistic particles that have momentum proportional to energy.
\end{sidebar}

\section{Magnitudes}
\label{s.magnitudes}

When observing a star, astronomers are collecting light over a range of frequencies. To compare observations, astronomers typically pass the light through standard filters and measure the transmitted flux. The flux in a given band is then
\[
	F_{\mathrm{band}} = \int F_{\lambda} \, \mathcal{T}(\lambda)\,\dif\lambda.
\]
Here $\mathcal{T}(\lambda)$ is the \newterm{transmission function} for that filter and specifies how much light is let through as a function of wavelength.  The transmission functions for some common UV/optical/IR filters are shown in Figure~\ref{f.UBVRI}. For example, the $V$-band filter is centered at $\lambda=\val{551}{\nano\meter}$ and has a width at half-max of $\val{88}{\nano\meter}$. 
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{UBVRI}
\caption[Standard filters]{\label{f.UBVRI} Some standard UV/optical/IR filters. The $\mathcal{T}(\lambda)$ are normalized so that $\max(\mathcal{T})=1$.}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercisebox}[Filter for observing sun-like star]
Suppose you wished to observe a sun-like star, and you wanted to observe wavelengths near the peak of the spectrum.  Which filter would you choose, and why?  What about for a star with a surface effective temperature $\Teff = \val{8\,000}{\K}$? 
\end{exercisebox}

When making observations, a common practice is to compare fluxes in a particular band between two stars. Optical astronomers define the \emph{apparent magnitude} $m$ via
\marginnote{NB. Throughout this text, $\log\equiv\lg$ denotes $\log_{10}$ and $\ln$ denotes $\log_{e}$.}
\begin{equation}\label{e.apparent-magnitude}
m(A) - m(B) = -2.5\log\left[\frac{F(A)}{F(B)}\right].
\end{equation}
Here $F(A)$ and $F(B)$ are two different measurements of flux (from two different stars, for example) in a particular waveband. In place of $m$, the usual practice, is to simply use the label of the waveband. For example, when an astronomer says, ``The $V$-magnitude is 16.6'', what she means is that the apparent magnitude measured in the $V$-filter is 16.6.

Because equation~(\ref{e.apparent-magnitude}) is a flux ratio, the absolute scale is not defined. Conversion from a magnitude to physical units, such as $\watt\usk\meter^{-2}\usk\nano\meter^{-1}$, is unfortunately difficult and not straightforward. Instead, the magnitude system is calibrated to specific stars.  The zero-point is usually set so that Vega has $U = B = V = \ldots = 0$\sidenote{But for historical reasons, $V(\textrm{Vega}) = +0.04$.}. 

Imagine comparing the flux from a star, at a distance $d$, with that from an imaginary identical star located at a distance of $\val{10}{\parsec}$. We'll call the magnitude of this imaginary star at $\val{10}{\parsec}$ the \newterm{absolute magnitude} $M$ and define the \newterm{distance modulus} as
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{DM} \equiv m-M &=& m(d) - m(\val{10}{\parsec})\nonumber\\
&=& -2.5\log\left[\frac{L/4\pi d^{2}}{L/4\pi(\val{10}{\parsec})^{2}}\right]\nonumber\\
&=& -2.5\log\left[\left(\frac{\val{10}{\parsec}}{d}\right)^{2}\right]\nonumber \\
&=& 5\log\left(\frac{d}{\parsec}\right) - 5.
\end{eqnarray}
Since the absolute magnitude is a measure of the flux from the star \emph{if it were} at a specified distance, the absolute magnitude is a proxy for the luminosity \emph{in a given filter}. Because magnitudes do not have a straightforward conversion to physical units, the absolute magnitude is again a relative scale for comparing stellar luminosities.

\newthought{We can also compare the flux from two different filters for the same star.} The difference in magnitudes betweem two different filters defines a \newterm{color index}, which measures where the star's spectrum peaks and is therefore a rough proxy for surface effective temperature. For example, the index
\[
	B - V = -2.5\log\left[\frac{\int_{B-\mathrm{band}}F_{\lambda}\,\dif\lambda}{\int_{V-\mathrm{band}}F_{\lambda}\,\dif\lambda}\right]
\]
measures the ratio of $V$-band flux to $B$-band flux for a particular star.

\begin{exercisebox}[Color index and temperature]
How would the $B-V$ index of the sun compare to that of a hotter star, e.g., one with $\Teff = \val{8\,000}{\K}$?
\end{exercisebox}

\begin{marginfigure}

\caption[Hipparcos color-magnitude diagram]{\label{f.Hipparcos-HR} Distribution of stars cataloged by \emph{Hipparcos} in $M_{V}$ and $B-V$.}
\end{marginfigure}
Figure~\ref{f.Hipparcos-HR} shows the absolute $M_{V}$ magnitudes and the $B-V$ color indices for 20\,853 nearby stars as measured by the \emph{Hipparcos} satellite\cite{Perryman1997The-Hipparcos-C}. \emph{Hipparcos} was launched by ESA in 1989 to measure parallaxes for over $10^{5}$ nearby stars. Its successor, \emph{Gaia}, is measuring positions and motions of about $10^{9}$ stars in the Milky Way. Fig.~\ref{f.Hipparcos-HR} represents a wide range of stellar masses and evolutionary stages. In the remaining chapters of these notes, we'll explore how the groupings on this diagram come about and trace the life of a star from birth to death.

\begin{exercisebox}[An examination of the color-magnitude diagram]
Let's examine the Hipparcos color-magnitude diagram, Fig.~\ref{f.Hipparcos-HR}, and understand the physical properties of the stars plotted on it.
\begin{enumerate}
\item On the axis $B-V$, indicate the direction ``red$\to$blue'' in visual appearance; assuming  thermal emission, indicate the direction of increasing surface temperature.
\item On the axis $M_{V}$, indicate the direction of increasing luminosity. What is the dynamic range (ratio, largest to smallest) of stellar luminosities on this plot?
\item Again assuming thermal emission, indicate the direction on the plot of increasing stellar size (radius).
\item Look up $M_{V}$ and $B-V$ for the sun, and indicate it on the plot.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercisebox}
