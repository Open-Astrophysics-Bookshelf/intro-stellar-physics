We saw in chapter~\ref{ch.basic-stellar-properties} that the equilibrium central temperature of a self-gravitating object---such as a star---with an ideal gas EOS depends \emph{solely} on the mass, radius, and composition of that star. For the Sun, this temperature is $\approx \val{15}{\Mega\K}$ and much higher than the surface effective temperature $T_{\!\mathrm{eff,\odot}} = \val{5780}{\K}$. The photons emitted from the Sun are coming from the cooler surface layers.

\newthought{Photons in a plasma, such as in the interior of the sun, transport energy.}  Were the sun transparent, these photons would immediately stream out, and the sun would release its stored energy in a fiery blast.  This doesn't happen: a photon can only travel a short distance before being scattered or absorbed. The net effect is that radiation generated in the core must travel a tortuous path, rather like a pinball, before reaching the surface and escaping.

\section{Interaction of radiation and matter}\label{s.interaction-radiation-matter}

How far does a photon---or any particle, for that matter---travel, on average, in the interior of the sun? Imagine a particle traveling with speed $v$.  Draw a cylinder, of length $\ell$ and cross-sectional area $\mathcal{A}$, around its path, as shown in Fig.~\ref{f.MFP}. What the particle ``sees'' is that the cylinder is partly blocked by obstacles---other particles in its path.
\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{mean-free-path}
    \caption{\label{f.MFP} Schematic of a particle incident on a group of scattering or absorbing particles.}
\end{marginfigure}

\newthought{What is the probability of our particle making it through the cylinder unscathed?} The probability of the particle hitting an obstacle is the ratio
\[
    \mathcal{P} = \frac{\textrm{total area covered by obstacles}}{\textrm{area of cylinder}}
\]
Denote the cross-sectional area of the other particles by $\sigma$. If the density of obstacles is $n$, then the number of obstacles in the cylinder is $n\times(\mathcal{A}\ell)$, and therefore the fraction of the area blocked by the obstacles is
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{P} = \frac{n\times(\mathcal{A}\ell)\times\sigma}{\mathcal{A}} = n\sigma\ell.
\label{e.prob-MFP}
\end{equation}
\marginnote{We are taking $\ell$ and $\mathcal{A}$ sufficiently small that we don't have to worry about particles overlapping.}
The particle will suffer a collision when $\mathcal{P}\to 1$, or when
\begin{equation}\label{e.MFP}
    \ell = \frac{1}{n\sigma}.
\end{equation}
We call $\ell$ the ``mean free path''.

\begin{marginfigure}[3\baselineskip]
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{air-hockey-mfp}
    \caption[Mean free path of a hockey puck]{\label{f.MFP-2D}Schematic for Exercise~\ref{ex.MFP-2D}}
\end{marginfigure}
\begin{exercisebox}[Mean free path of a hockey puck]\label{ex.MFP-2D}
    Suppose we have a flat, slippery surface on which hockey pucks are sliding around, as shown in Fig.~\ref{f.MFP-2D}. The pucks bounce off the walls as they slide around.  Suppose there are $N$ pucks, each with unit diameter, and the table is square with sides of length $L$.  Estimate the mean free path of a puck.
\end{exercisebox}

Although we have motivated this derivation with a classical picture, the cross-section $\sigma$ is just related to the probability of an interaction and can therefore be defined for quantum mechanical systems.

\begin{exercisebox}[Mean free path for electron scattering]\label{ex.MFP}
    In the sun, free electrons scatter photons; the cross-section for this is
    \[
    \sigma_{\mathrm{Th}} = \left(\frac{8\pi}{3}\right)\left(\frac{e^2}{m_e c^2}\right)^2 = \val{\sci{6.65}{-27}}{\meter^2}.
    \]
    What is the mean free path against this process for a photon at the average density of the solar interior?
\end{exercisebox}

As the ray of light traverses a small distance $\Delta s$ through some matter, the probability of a photon being absorbed is $\mathcal{P} = n\sigma\Delta s$. Thus, out of every $N$ photons, $\Delta N = N \times\mathcal{P} = N\times n\sigma\Delta s$ are absorbed. Since the intensity $I_{\nu}$ is proportional to the number of photons, the change in intensity is just
\[ \Delta I_{\nu} = -n\sigma I_{\nu}\Delta s. \]
Taking the limit $\Delta s\to0$, we obtain an equation for the absorption of light,
\begin{equation}\label{e.absorption-microscopic}
\left.\DD{I_{\nu}}{s}\right|_{\mathrm{absorption}} = -n\sigma I_{\nu}.
\end{equation}
Rather than work with the microscopic cross-section, it is convenient to define the \newterm{absorption opacity},
\[
	\kapabs = \frac{n\sigma}{\rho},
\]
so that $\dif I_{\nu}/\dif s = -\rho\kapabs I_{\nu}$. The units of opacity are $\cm^{2}/\gram$. We use a subscript $\nu$ to indicate that the opacity is a function of frequency. In terms of the opacity, the photon mean free path is $\ell = (\rho\kapabs)^{-1}$.

\begin{exercisebox}[Attenuation of light in an absorbing medium]
A ray of light crosses a slab of absorbent material. Calculate the intensity $I_{\nu}$ as a function of distance traveled. Your expression should be in terms of $\rho$ and $\kapabs$. How far does the ray go before its intensity has dropped to $1/e$ of its original value?
\end{exercisebox}

\newthought{In addition to absorbing photons, the matter can also spontaneously emit them.} Denote the power emitted per wavelength per volume per angle by $\rho j_{\nu}$. After traveling a distance $\Delta s$ through matter with this \newterm{emissivity}, the ray will increase in intensity by $\rho j_{\nu}\Delta s$; or
\begin{equation}\label{e.emission-microscopic}
\left.\DD{I_{\nu}}{s}\right|_{\mathrm{emission}} = \rho j_{\nu}.
\end{equation}

\begin{exercisebox}[Combined absorption and emission]
Suppose a ray traverses matter that both absorbs (opacity $\kapabs$) and emits (emissivity $j_{\nu}$), so that
\[	\DD{I_{\nu}}{s} = \rho j_{\nu} - \rho\kapabs I_{\nu}. \]
Solve for $I_{\nu}(s)$, and show that as $s\to\infty$, $I_{\nu}\to j_{\nu}/\kapabs$.
\label{ex.intensity-at-large-depth}
\end{exercisebox}

\newthought{Finally, the matter can also scatter light.} This removes photons from a ray, similar to absorption, but it also adds them into a ray propagating in a different direction. 
If we assume that the direction into which the photon is scattered is random and isotropic (as is most often the case), then if the intensity in our ray is greater than the angle-average $J_{\nu}$, scattering will cause a net reduction in intensity as more photons are scattered out of the ray than are scattered into it. Conversely, if $I_{\nu} < J_{\nu}$, then more photons will be scattered into the ray than out of it. Thus, the effect of scattering can be described via
\begin{equation}\label{e.scattering-microscopic}
\left.\DD{I_{\nu}}{s}\right|_{\mathrm{scattering}} = -\rho\kapscat \left(I_{\nu} - J_{\nu}\right).
\end{equation}

\section{The equation of radiative transfer}
\label{s.equation-radiative-transfer}

Combining our expressions for absorption, emission, and scattering gives us the full expression for how the intensity changes along a ray,
\begin{equation}\label{e.transfer-equation}
\DD{I_{\nu}}{s} = -\rho\left(\kapabs + \kapscat\right) I_{\nu} + \rho j_{\nu} + \rho\kapscat J_{\nu}.
\end{equation}
This is a complicated \newterm{integrodifferential} equation: it contains both the derivative $\dif I_{\nu}/\dif s$ of the intensity as well as its integral $J_{\nu} = (4\pi)^{-1}\int I_{\nu}\,\dif\Omega$.

In general, eq.~(\ref{e.transfer-equation}) must be solved numerically; but conditions in the deep interior of the star and near the surface allow us to make simplifying approximations and to obtain a solution that gives some insight into the physics. First, let's clean up the equation: divide through by $\rho\kappa_{\nu}\equiv\rho(\kapabs + \kapscat)$,
\[
	\frac{1}{\rho\kappa_{\nu}}\dd{I_{\nu}}{s} = -I_{\nu} + \left[\frac{j_{\nu} + \kapscat J_{\nu}}{\kappa_{\nu}}\right].
\]
Next, define a new quantity, the \newterm{optical depth} $\tau_{\nu}$ via the equation
\[
	\dd{\tau_{\nu}}{s} = \rho\kappa_{\nu} = \rho(\kapabs+\kapscat),
\]
which allows us to change variables, $\dif I_{\nu}/\dif s = (\dif I_{\nu}/\dif\tau_{\nu})\cdot(\dif\tau_{\nu}/\dif s)$; and finally define the \newterm{source function} $S_{\nu}$ as the term in $\left[\cdot\right]$. Doing all that gives us the simpler-looking equation,
\[
	\DD{I_{\nu}}{\tau_{\nu}} = -I_{\nu} + S_{\nu}.
\]
This prettifying doesn't advance us any closer to the solution, but notice! The optical depth has a simple meaning:
\[
	\tau_{\nu} = \int_{0}^{s} \rho\kappa_{\nu}\,\dif s = \int_{0}^{s} n\sigma_{\nu}\,\dif s = \int_{0}^{s} \frac{\dif s}{\lambda}.
\]
That is, the optical depth measures distance along the ray in units of mean free path. Said differently, if you have traveled one optical depth, then you have gone one mean free path. We also see from this equation that $I_{\nu}\to S_{\nu}$ as $\tau_{\nu}\to\infty$ (cf.\ exercise~\ref{ex.intensity-at-large-depth}).

Thus, if your object has $\tau_{\nu}\ll 1$, then photons are hardly affected by the medium and the object is nearly transparent; if, on the other hand, $\tau_{\nu} \gg 1$, then photons cannot go through the object: it is opaque, and the emission is determined by the emissivity (via the source function $S_{\nu}$) of the matter.

\begin{exercisebox}[Optical depth of the solar center]
For the electron scattering cross-section (Exercise~\ref{ex.MFP}), estimate the optical depth between the solar center and the solar photosphere.
\end{exercisebox}

\newthought{Suppose we are in a cavity in which the radiation and matter are in a steady-state}. 
The matter is not gaining or losing energy to the radiation. This requires balancing
\[ \left(\textrm{energy emitted per unit volume}\right) = \rho\int j_{\nu}\,\dif\nu\,\dif\Omega\] 
with
\[ \left(\textrm{energy absorbed per unit volume}\right) = \rho\int \kapabs I_{\nu}\,\dif\nu\,\dif\Omega,\]
so that
\begin{equation}\label{e.rad-equil}
\int_{0}^{\infty}\! \left(j_{\nu} - \kapabs J_{\nu}\right)\,\dif\nu = 0.
\end{equation}
We don't include scattering in this expression because scattering doesn't transfer energy between the radiation and the gas.

If, in addition, the matter and radiation are in thermal equilibrium, so that $J_{\nu} = B_{\nu}$, then eq.~(\ref{e.rad-equil}) implies that
\begin{equation}\label{e.detailed-balance}
\frac{j_{\nu}}{\kapabs} = B_{\nu}(T).
\end{equation}
Now $j_{\nu}$ and $\kapabs$ are properties of the matter, and do not depend on the state of the radiation field. Hence, equation~(\ref{e.detailed-balance}) must hold whenever the matter is in equilibrium, \emph{regardless of the state of the radiation field}.

\section{Radiative diffusion}

We can now examine how heat transport works in the deep interior of a star. First, we need to adjust our coordinates. In equation~(\ref{e.transfer-equation}), the coordinate $s$ is distance along a ray; but we are considering many different rays. We shall therefore use radial distance $r$ as a coordinate, and measure the optical depth it: $\dif\tau_{\nu} = \rho\kappa_{\nu}\,\dif r$. 
Since $\dif r = \mu\,\dif s$, where $\mu=\cos\theta$ is the cosine between $\dif s$ and $\dif r$ (Fig.~\ref{f.dr-ds-relation}), the equation of transfer becomes
\begin{equation}
\mu\DD{I_{\nu}}{r} = -\rho\kappa_{\nu}\left(I_{\nu} - S_{\nu}\right).
\end{equation}
\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{dr-ds-relation}
\caption{\label{f.dr-ds-relation} Schematic of coordinate for solving the radiative transport equation.}
\end{marginfigure}

\newthought{Let's examine the typical scales of terms in the radiative transfer equation, for conditions in the deep solar interior.} We'll start with eq.~(\ref{e.transfer-equation}), and indicate some expected scales:
\[
\underbrace{\mu\DD{I_{\nu}}{r}}_{\sim I_{\nu}/\Rsun} = -\underbrace{\rho\kappa_{\nu} I_{\nu}}_{\sim I_{\nu}/\lambda}  +\rho\kappa_{\nu} S_{\nu}.
\]
If we are far from the surface of the star, then we should expect the intensity to change over lengthscales comparable to $\Rsun$. Of course, it won't be exactly this, but---as we'll show---the exact value doesn't matter so long as $|\dif I_{\nu}/\dif s|$ is in the ballpark of $I_{\nu}/\Rsun$. Notice the enormous disparity in scales:
\[
	\frac{|\dif I_{\nu}/\dif r|}{\rho\kappa_{\nu}I_{\nu}} \sim \frac{\lambda}{\Rsun};
\]
the left-hand side is smaller than the terms on the right by the ratio of the mean free path to the solar radius. This implies that conditions are nearly homogeneous. They are also isotropic, so that $I_{\nu} = J_{\nu}$. We expect that collisions are fast enough so that the matter is in thermal equilibrium and $j_{\nu} = \kapabs B_{\nu}$. We also know from exercise~\ref{ex.intensity-at-large-depth} that $I_{\nu} \to j_{\nu}/\kapabs = B_{\nu}$.

We can't have $I_{\nu} = B_{\nu}$ exactly, however, since in that case there is no net flux! We'll treat the intensity as a perturbation to its thermal value:
\[ I_{\nu} = B_{\nu} + I_{\nu}^{(1)}, \]
where the superscript ``(1)'' indicates that this is a small correction. Inserting this expansion into eq.~(\ref{e.transfer-equation}) and keeping only the lowest-order terms on each side gives
\begin{equation}\label{e.perturbation-radiative-transfer}
I_{\nu}^{(1)} = -\mu\DD{B_{\nu}}{\tau_{\nu}}.
\end{equation}
$B_{\nu}$ depends on the temperature $T$, so $\dif B_{\nu}/\dif\tau_{\nu} = \dif B_{\nu}/\dif T \cdot \dif T/\dif \tau_{\nu}$. To get the flux, multiply eq.~(\ref{e.perturbation-radiative-transfer}) by $\mu$ and integrate over angles:
\[ F_{\nu} = \int\mu I_{\nu}^{(1)}\,\dif\Omega = -\int \mu^{2}\DD{B_{\nu}}{T}\,\DD{T}{\tau_{\nu}}\,\dif \Omega = -\frac{4\pi}{3} \DD{B_{\nu}}{T}\,\DD{T}{\tau_{\nu}}. \]
We can switch back to the radial coordinate:
\begin{equation}\label{e.specific-radiative-transport}
	F_{\nu} = -\frac{4\pi}{3}\left[\frac{1}{\rho\kappa_{\nu}}\dd{B_{\nu}}{T}\right]\DD{T}{r}.
\end{equation}
The term in $\left[\cdot\right]$ controls which frequencies are most responsible for energy transport.

\begin{exercisebox}[Transport by frequency]
\label{ex.radiative-transfer}
Let's examine the term $\left[\cdot\right]$ in eq.~(\ref{e.specific-radiative-transport}) more closely. Fig.~\ref{f.planck} shows $B_{\nu}$ and $\dif B_{\nu}/\dif T$ (top panel) and a hypothetical $\kappa_{\nu}$ (middle). Sketch $F_{\nu}$ on the bottom panel.  For which frequencies is it maximum?
\end{exercisebox}

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{radiative-transfer-exercise}
\caption{\label{f.planck} Comparison of the Planck function and its derivative w.r.t.\ temperature, the opacity, and the specific flux.}
\end{marginfigure}

To get the total flux, we integrate $F_{\nu}$ over all frequencies. 
\begin{eqnarray*}
	F = \int_{0}^{\infty}F_{\nu}\,\dif\nu &=& -\frac{4\pi}{3} \left[\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\rho\kappa_{\nu}}\dd{B_{\nu}}{T}\right]\DD{T}{r}\\
	&\equiv& -\frac{4\pi}{3}\frac{1}{\rho\kappa_{\mathrm{R}}}\dd{}{T}\left[\int_{0}^{\infty}B_{\nu}\,\dif\nu\right]\DD{T}{r}.
\end{eqnarray*}
Here we've defined the \newterm{Rosseland mean} of the opacity:
\begin{equation}\label{e.rosseland-opacity}
	\frac{1}{\kappa_{\mathrm{R}}} = \left(\int_{0}^{\infty} \dd{B_{\nu}}{T}\,\dif\nu\right)^{-1}\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\kappa_{\nu}}\dd{B_{\nu}}{T}\,\dif\nu.
\end{equation}
This is done to put the equation in more familiar terms. Since (cf.\ eq.~[\ref{e.bolometric-thermal-flux}]) $\int B_{\nu}\,\dif\nu = \sigmaSB T^{4}/\pi = c a T^{4}/4\pi$, we can write the equation for the flux as
\begin{equation}
	F = -\frac{1}{3}\frac{c}{\rho\kappa_{\mathrm{R}}}\DD{}{r}aT^{4}.
\label{e.radiative-transfer}
\end{equation}
Equation (\ref{e.radiative-transfer}) is known as the equation for radiative diffusion, for reasons that will become apparent in the next section.

If we multiply the flux by the surface area of a shell in the star we obtain the luminosity $L = 4\pi r^{2} F$; we can therefore recast eq.~(\ref{e.radiative-transfer}) into an equation for the thermal gradient:
\begin{equation}
    \label{e.gradient-temperature}
    \DD{T}{r} = -\frac{3\rho\kappa_{R}}{4acT^3}\frac{L(r)}{4\pi r^2}.
\end{equation}

\begin{exercisebox}[Radiative transfer equation]
\label{ex.radiative-transfer-diffusion}
Let's dissect eq.~(\ref{e.radiative-transfer}) to see how it sets the luminosity.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{p.F-L}
To keep the algebra simple, assume that $F$ is constant throughout the star and that $aT^{4}$ is linear in $r$---that is, $aT^{4} = aT_{c}^{4}(1-r/R)$.  Since $F$ is constant, you can express it in terms of the luminosity at the surface $L$.  Use this to transform eq.~(\ref{e.radiative-transfer}) into an expression for $L$ in terms of $R$ and $T_{c}$ (along with $\rho$, $\kappa_{\mathrm{R}}$, and $c$).

\item\label{p.L-tau}
Write the luminosity as $L = E_{\gamma}/\tau$, where $E_{\gamma}$ is the total radiative energy of the star, and $\tau$ some as-yet-undetermined \emph{diffusion timescale}.  Give an estimate of $E_{\gamma}$ in terms of the mean temperature $T$ and the radius $R$ of the star.

\item\label{p.tau}
Finally, assume that the photon mean free path $\lambda = (\rho\kappa_{\mathrm{R}})^{-1}$ is constant.  Substitute the results from parts \ref{p.F-L} and \ref{p.L-tau} into equation~(\ref{e.radiative-transfer}).  After simplifying, you should end up with a simple expression for $\tau$ in terms of $c$, $R$, and $\lambda$.  For Thomson scattering, what is $\tau$ (express in years)?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercisebox}

\section{Diffusion}\label{s.diffusion}

In the presence of scattering or absorption, the photons crossing the face can travel one mean free path $\ell$. Imagine a small cube with sides of length $\ell$ and filled with photons. The total radiant energy in the cube is $\Delta E$. In a time $\Delta t = \ell/c$, all of the energy will leave this cube. The total luminosity is $\Delta E/\Delta t = c\Delta E/\ell$. If everything is isotropic, then the flux out of any one face is $1/6$ of the luminosity, divided by the area of that face:
\[
	F = \frac{1}{6\ell^{2}}\frac{c\Delta E}{\ell} = \frac{1}{6}c U,
\]
where $U = E/\ell^{3}$ is the radiative energy density. 

Now place two of these cubes against one another, with their common face located at position $x$. The energy density of the two cubes need not be the same; the energy density of the left cube is $U(x-\ell)$ and of the right cube is $U(x+\ell)$ (see Fig.~\ref{f.diffusive-flux}). The net flux traveling in the $x$-direction through the common face is then
\[
	F = {\color{blue}\frac{1}{6} c U(x-\ell)} - {\color{red}\frac{1}{6} c U(x+\ell)} \approx -\frac{1}{3}c\ell \DDx{U}.
\]
This is an expression for a \newterm{diffusive flux}. Although we gave a heuristic explanation, the formula is in general true:
\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber
(\textrm{flux of something}) &=& -\frac{1}{3}\times(\textrm{speed of carriers})\times(\textrm{MFP of carriers})\\
&&\times \grad(\textrm{density of something})
\label{e.diffusive-flux}
\end{eqnarray}
For radiation, the ``something'' is ``radiative energy'' and the carriers are photons.
\begin{marginfigure}[-12\baselineskip]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{diffusive-flux}
\caption{\label{f.diffusive-flux} Illustration of net flux crossing a face between regions with slightly different energy densities.}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{exercisebox}[Rosseland weighting]
Compare this crude diffusion model,
\[
	F = -\frac{1}{3}c\lambda\DD{U}{r},
\]
with eq.~(\ref{e.radiative-transfer}). Using the results of exercise~\ref{ex.radiative-transfer}, give a succinct description for why the effective mean free path $\lambda = 1/(\rho\kappa_{\mathrm{R}})$ is computed using a weighting function $\partial B_{\nu}/\partial T$.
\end{exercisebox}

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{random-walk-schematic}
\caption{\label{f.random-walk-schematic}Schematic of a random walk of 50 steps.}
\end{marginfigure}
\newthought{As an alternate take on our estimation, let's model the transport as a photon that is randomly walking throughout the interior.}
The photon moves at speed $c$, but it can only go one mean free path $\lambda$ before being absorbed or scattered, at which point it is sent off in a random direction.\marginnote{To keep things simple, we'll imagine that after absorption the atom immediately emits an identical photon in a random direction.} The path of the photon will therefore look something like that in Fig.~\ref{f.random-walk-schematic}.

We will just do our calculation for motion along a diameter, with the photon starting at the center. At each hop, the photon either goes left or right with equal probability. On average, the photon doesn't go anywhere; but after enough hops, there is some probability for the photon to reach the edge of the star and escape. Figure~\ref{f.random-walk} shows the distribution of positions for walks of length $n = 10, 30, 100, 300$ steps, with each step having length 1.0. Suppose the edge of the star is at $x=\pm 10$ (red dotted lines).  Although the average position is at $x=0$, for $n \gtrsim 100$ steps, there is a reasonable probability of the photon escaping.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\forceversofloat
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{random-walk}
\caption{\label{f.random-walk} Distribution of positions after $n$ steps in a random walk.}
\end{figure}

To make this into a workable model, let us first recall the basic features of a random walk. It is described by a binomial distribution: after $n$ steps, the probability that $m$ of them were to the right is
\begin{equation}\label{e.binomial}
    \binom{n}{m}{p} = \frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!} p^{m}(1-p)^{n-m}.
\end{equation}
Here $p$ is the probability of any single step being to the right.
The mean and root variance of $m$ are
\begin{eqnarray}
	\mean{m} &=& np \label{e.mean-binomial} \\
	\left[\mean{\left(m-\mean{m}\right)^{2}}\right]^{1/2} &=& \left[np(1-p)\right]^{1/2}. \label{e.var-binomial}
\end{eqnarray}
We can use these to estimate the diffusion timescale $\tau$.

\begin{exercisebox}[Radiative diffusion as a random walk]
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Show from equation~(\ref{e.mean-binomial}) that the mean distance traveled by the photon after $n$ steps is $\langle d\rangle = \lambda(2np-n)$, so for $p=1/2$, $\langle d\rangle = 0$.

\item
If all the steps were in the same direction, how many steps are needed to reach the edge, at a a distance $R$ from the center? Assume all steps have the same length $\lambda$.

\item\label{p.straight-line-steps}
We want the distribution of steps (cf.\ Fig.~\ref{f.random-walk}) to be wide enough to reach the edge. Set the root variance---a measure of the width of the probability distribution---equal to this number of steps in part~\ref{p.straight-line-steps}, and use equation~(\ref{e.var-binomial}) to find $n_{\mathrm{edge}}$ in terms of $R$ and $\lambda$.

\item
What is the \emph{total} distance traveled by the photon after $n_{\mathrm{edge}}$ steps? If the photon traveled at speed $c$, how long did it take? Compare your answer with that for part~\ref{p.tau} of exercise~\ref{ex.radiative-transfer-diffusion}.

\end{enumerate}
\end{exercisebox}
