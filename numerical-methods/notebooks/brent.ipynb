    "# Brent's Method: A Better Rootfind Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Our workhorse routine for finding a root is *bisection*.  Given a function $f(x)$ and an interval $x\\in[a,b]$ such that $f(a) < 0, f(b) > 0$ or $f(a) > 0, f(b) < 0$, bisection is guaranteed to converge to the root.  As you know, this method works by finding the midpoint $m = (a+b)/2$; if the root lies in $[a,m]$ then the routine sets $b=m$, otherwise if the root lies in $[m,b]$ the routine sets $a=m$. The process then repeats until $|b-a|$ is smaller than some specified tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although bisection is guaranteed to converge, it isn't particularly smart. In this notebook, we'll demonstrate a smarter algorithm, known as *Brent's method*.  Let's begin by defining a suitable trial function, $f(x) = \\sin(x)$, on an interval $x\\in[1.5,4]$.  We'll use this $f(x)$ to explore different rootfind strategies."
