    "As a worked example, suppose we want to find the root for the function $f(x) = x^2-2$ with $x > 0$. That is, we want to find $r > 0$ such that $f(x=r) = 0$. Of course, the answer has an algebraic solution, namely $\\sqrt{2}$ so we don't need to find an approximate numerical answer. We can, however, easily find problems for which the only recourse is to obtain a numerical answer."
