We now have almost all of the physics necessary to describe the life of a star. The nuclear physics enters in an equation for the luminosity, which we shall derive next. We then need to discuss departures from the classical ideal gas equation of state; this becomes important for low-mass stars and sets the minimum stellar mass.

\section{The luminosity equation}

We've established the relations for the enclosed mass,
\begin{equation}\label{e.mass}
\DD{m}{r} = 4\pi r^{2}\rho,
\end{equation}
the pressure,
\begin{equation}\label{e.pressure}
\DD{P}{r} = -\rho\frac{Gm}{r^{2}},
\end{equation}
and the temperature,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{e.temperature-radiative}
\DD{T}{r} &=& - \frac{L}{4\pi r^{2}}\frac{3\rho\kappa}{4ac T^{3}}\qquad \textrm{in radiative regions;} \\ 
\label{e.temperature-convective}
\DD{T}{r} &=& \frac{T}{P}\tderiv{\ln T}{\ln P}{S}\DD{P}{r} \quad \textrm{in convective regions}.
\end{eqnarray}
We need an equation for the luminosity $L(r)$, which we now derive.

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{luminosity-eqn}
\caption[Heat balance in a mass shell]{Heat balance in a shell $\Delta m$.}
\label{f.luminosity}
\end{marginfigure}
Suppose we have a shell of mass $\Delta m$ lying between surfaces $r$ and $r+\Delta r$ (Fig.~\ref{f.luminosity}). The shell gains heat from nuclear reactions at a rate $\Delta m \times \varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ is the heating rate per unit mass.  In addition, there is heat entering the shell from below at a rate $L(r)$ and heat leaving the top of the shell at a rate $-L(r+\Delta r)$.
If the shell is neither gaining or losing heat, then these terms must balance:
\[ 4\pi r^{2}\rho\varepsilon\,\Delta r + L(r) - L(r+\Delta r) = 0. \]
This reduces to our fourth equation of stellar structure,
\begin{equation}
\label{e.luminosity}
\DD{L}{r} = 4\pi r^{2}\rho\varepsilon.
\end{equation}

\begin{sidebar}[The equations of stellar structure in Lagrangian form]
\label{sb.lagrangian-equations}
The equations (\ref{e.mass}), (\ref{e.pressure}), (\ref{e.temperature-radiative})-(\ref{e.temperature-convective}), and (\ref{e.luminosity}) must in general be solved numerically. In practice, the radius $r$ is not the most convenient variable to use as a coordinate. In one-dimension, the mass in each shell remains distinct, so the enclosed mass
\[
	m(r) = \int_{0}^{r} 4\pi r^{2}\rho\,\dif r
\]
makes a useful coordinate. This is called a \newterm{Lagrangian} description of the star.  Upon changing variables, the structure equations become
\begin{eqnarray}
\DD{r}{m} &=& \frac{1}{4\pi r^{2}\rho}\label{e.lagrange-r}\\
\DD{P}{m} &=& \DD{P}{r}\DD{r}{m} = -\frac{Gm}{4\pi r^{4}}\label{e.lagrange-P}\\
\DD{T}{m} &=& - \frac{3\kappa L}{64\pi^{2} r^{4} acT^{3}}\qquad \textrm{where radiative}\label{e.lagrange-T-radiative}\\
\DD{T}{m} &=& -\frac{T}{P}\tderiv{\ln T}{\ln P}{S}\frac{Gm}{4\pi r^{4}} \quad \textrm{where convective}\label{e.lagrange-T-convective}\\
\DD{L}{m} &=& \varepsilon.\label{e.lagrange-L}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{sidebar}

Equations (\ref{e.mass})--(\ref{e.luminosity}), or equivalently (\ref{e.lagrange-r})--(\ref{e.lagrange-L}), are supplemented by an equation of state $P = P(\rho,T)$ and opacity $\kappa = \kappa(\rho,T)$, as well as equations for the change in composition ($\dif X/\dif t$) due to nuclear burning. Note that we've also omitted terms allowing for expansion or contraction ($\dif r/\dif t$) from these equations.

\section{Contraction to the main sequence}
\label{s.contraction-to-main-sequence}

Stars are formed when clouds of gas and dust fall out of pressure balance and become unstable to gravitational collapse. Often, the cloud fragments into a myriad of small collapsing regions, such as in the Soul Nebula pictured in Fig.~\ref{f.soul-nebula}. In the center of these dense knots, a core comes into hydrostatic equilibrium and grows in mass as matter continues to infall. Much of this process is obscured from view by the surrounding clouds of gas and dust.
\begin{marginfigure}

\caption[Soul Nebula]{\label{f.soul-nebula} Image of the Soul Nebula (IC 1848) in the constellation Cassiopeia. Credit: Jos\'e Jim\'enez Priego (Astromet).}
\end{marginfigure}

As the nebula thins out, the star continues to contract slowly on a Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale, eq.~(\ref{e.kelvin-helmholtz}), as the core is still too cool for nuclear reactions to power the luminosity from the surface (remember, the luminosity is set by the mass of the star and its opacity). As the central temperature rises, the nuclear reaction rate increases rapidly until the heat released by reactions balances that emitted from the surface. At that point the star is on the \newterm{zero-age main sequence} (ZAMS). Of course, not all collapsing stellar-like objects reach the ZAMS---objects that are too low in mass will not ignite hydrogen fusion, while objects that are too high in mass tend to be unstable and eject mass. We'll explore these limits in the next few sections.

\begin{exercisebox}[Central temperature and density of a contracting pre-main-sequence star]
\label{ex.contraction-to-main-sequence}
This exercise revisits problem~\ref{ex.contraction-constant-density-protostar}. In that exercise you modeled how the density and temperature changed as a pre-main-sequence star contracted. Table~\ref{t.stellar-rhoT} gives central densities and temperatures of stars at the onset of hydrogen fusion (known as the \newterm{zero-age main sequence}). These temperatures and densities are plotted below and labeled by stellar mass. Assume an ideal-gas equation of state and use the virial relations for the temperature and central density to plot the tracks in this plane each star followed during its contraction.

\subsection{Degeneracy}
\label{s.degeneracy}

As a star contracts, the particles within it are packed ever closer together.  As we saw from our discussion of ionization, the behavior of particles must change when the separation between particles is of the order of the uncertainty in their positions.  Equivalently, our classical description breaks down when the particle density exceeds roughly
\begin{equation}\label{e.heuristic-quantum-density}
    \frac{1\;\textrm{particle}}{(\Delta x)^3} 
    = \left(\frac{\Delta p}{h}\right)^3 
    \sim \left(\frac{m\kB T}{h^2}\right)^{3/2}.
\end{equation}
Another way to put this is that quantum effects become important when there is roughly 1 particle in a normalized phase space volume $\dif^{3}x\,\dif^{3}p/h^{3}$.

Suppose we have two identical particles in a quantum state. Since the particles are identical, if we exchange them the wavefunction can only change by a phase factor\sidenote{See Box~\ref{sb.identical-particles}} $e^{i\delta}$. If we exchange the particles again, we are back to our original state; as a result, $e^{2i\delta} = 1$, and therefore $\delta = 0$ or $\pi$. Hence upon the exchange of particles, the wavefunction either is unchanged ($\delta=0$) or it changes sign ($e^{i\pi}=-1$).
\begin{quote}\itshape
    There are two types of particles in this world: those that change sign under exchange; and those that don't.
\end{quote}
Particles that don't change sign under exchange are called \newterm{bosons} and have integer spin. Photons ($\textrm{spin} = 1$) are bosons. Particles that change sign under exchange are called \newterm{fermions} and have half-integer spin. Electrons, neutrinos, protons, and neutrons ($\textrm{spin} = 1/2$) are all fermions. 

A consequence of the fermion wavefunction changing sign when any two particles are exchanged is that the wavefunction vanishes if any two particles are in the same state---that is, they have the same position, momentum, and spin. For spin-half particles like electrons, then means we can put at most two such electrons in the same position and momentum state; we do this by having their spins antiparallel.

\begin{sidebar}[Identical Particles]
\label{sb.identical-particles}
To understand how the interchange of identical particles works in more detail, let's start by recalling some features of quantum mechanics. This discussion is based on  \citet{Feynman1989The-Feynman-Lec}.
We denote a particle's state as $\ket{a}$, where $a$ is just a label.  For example, $a$ could be "electron with such-and-such momentum".  The probability of finding the electron in some other state $\ket{\phi}$ is given by $|\braket{\phi}{a}|^2$, where $\braket{\phi}{a}$ is a complex number known as the probability amplitude formed via an inner product of $\ket{\phi}$ and $\ket{a}$.

Now suppose we have two particles, a and b, and we scatter them so that one particle ends up in detector 1 and the other ends up in detector 2. There are two ways this can go, as shown here.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{scattering-classical}
\end{center}
Classically, we would argue that the probability of getting either particle in detector 1 is just
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{P}(\textrm{a or b in 1}) = \mathcal{P}(\textrm{a in 1}) + \mathcal{P}(\textrm{b in 1}).
\end{equation}
If particles a and b are different---e.g., one is a \carbon\ nucleus and the other is an \oxygen\ nucleus---then this holds in quantum mechanics as well. Quantum mechanically, we write
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{P}(\textrm{a or b in 1}) = |\braket{1}{a}\braket{2}{b}|^2 + |\braket{2}{a}\braket{1}{b}|^2.
\end{equation}
If the particles are identical, however---for example, if a and b are two electrons with identical spin---then this picture is wrong.

Because of the uncertainty principle, we cannot follow the trajectories of a and b with infinite precision to see which is which; instead, the situation is more analogous to the depiction shown here.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{scattering-quantum}
\end{center}
There are now two indistinguishable ways of arriving at the final state---in this case, an electron in detector 1 and an electron in detector 2. According to quantum mechanics, we must therefore sum the amplitudes for getting to the final state, \emph{before taking the square}. That is, the probability for this one particle to end up in detector 1 and the other to end up in detector 2 is
\begin{eqnarray}
    \mathcal{P}(\textrm{a or b in 1}) &=& |\braket{1}{a}\braket{2}{b} + \braket{2}{a}\braket{1}{b}|^2\nonumber\\
    &=& |\braket{1}{a}\braket{2}{b}|^2 + |\braket{2}{a}\braket{1}{b}|^2 \nonumber\\
    && + {\color{red}\left[ \braket{1}{a}^*\braket{2}{b}^*\braket{2}{a}\braket{1}{b}\right.} \nonumber\\
    && {\color{red}+ \left.\braket{2}{a}^*\braket{1}{b}^*\braket{1}{a}\braket{2}{b}\right]} \nonumber\\
    &=& \mathcal{P}(\textrm{a in 1}) + \mathcal{P}(\textrm{b in 1}) \nonumber\\
    && + {\color{red}\left[ \braket{1}{a}^*\braket{2}{b}^*\braket{2}{a}\braket{1}{b}\right.}\nonumber\\
    && {\color{red}+ \left.\braket{2}{a}^*\braket{1}{b}^*\braket{1}{a}\braket{2}{b}\right]}.
    \label{e.scattering-quantum}
\end{eqnarray}
The probability of scattering an electron into detector 1 is the classical value plus the \emph{additional} interference term in $\color{red}[\cdot]$.

\newthought{To see the effect of this interference term on the thermal properties of the system,} let's imagine putting two particles into the same small volume.  To do this, we imagine the detectors 1 and 2 sliding together until they overlap, as shown here.  
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fermions}
\end{center}
Since detectors 1 and 2 are approaching one another, we must have
\begin{equation}
    |\braket{1}{a}\braket{2}{b}|^2 = |\braket{2}{a}\braket{1}{b}|^2.
\end{equation}
This does not imply, however, that $\braket{1}{a}\braket{2}{b} = \braket{2}{a}\braket{1}{b}$: the amplitudes could differ by a phase factor, so that interchanging the particles would yield
\[
    \braket{2}{a}\braket{1}{b} = e^{i\delta}\braket{1}{a}\braket{2}{b}.
\]
If we interchange the particles, and then interchange them again, we get
\[
    \braket{1}{a}\braket{2}{b} = e^{2i\delta}\braket{1}{a}\braket{2}{b};
\]
since swapping the particles twice just gets up back to the original situation, we must have that $e^{2i\delta} = 1$ and therefore $e^{i\delta} = \pm 1$.

If there is no change of sign, i.e., $\braket{2}{a}\braket{1}{b} = \braket{1}{a}\braket{2}{b}$, then from equation~(\ref{e.scattering-quantum}) we have
\begin{equation}\label{e.boson}
    \mathcal{P}(\textrm{a or b in 1}) = 2|\braket{1}{a}\braket{2}{b}|^2 + 2|\braket{2}{a}\braket{1}{b}|^2.
\end{equation}
This is \emph{twice} the classical value: the probability of the particles entering the same state is enhanced.

In contrast, if $\braket{2}{a}\braket{1}{b} = -\braket{1}{a}\braket{2}{b}$, then equation~(\ref{e.scattering-quantum}) implies that
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{P}(\textrm{a or b in 1}) &=& |\braket{1}{a}\braket{2}{b}| + |\braket{2}{a}\braket{1}{b}| \nonumber\\ 
    && - |\braket{1}{a}\braket{2}{b}| - |\braket{2}{a}\braket{1}{b}| \nonumber\\ 
    &=& 0.\label{e.fermion}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{quote}\itshape
We cannot have 2 identical particles with the same momentum, position, and spin if their wavefunction changes sign when the particles are exchanged.
\end{quote}
Particles with integer spin (i.e., their angular momentum is an integer multiple of $\hbar$) have wavefunctions that do not change sign under exchange; these particles are said to obey \emph{Bose-Einstein statistics} and are called \emph{bosons}.  Particles with half-integer spin have wavefunctions that do change sign under exchange; these particles are said to obey \emph{Fermi-Dirac statistics} and are called \emph{fermions}.  Photons are bosons; electrons, protons, neutrons, and neutrinos are fermions.
\end{sidebar}

\newthought{To account for Fermi-Dirac statistics within the equation of state,} we begin by imagining a small volume containing $N$ electrons. Motivated by eq.~(\ref{e.heuristic-quantum-density}), we divide the phase space into cells,
\[
	\frac{\dif^{3}x\,\dif^{3}p}{h^{3}},
\]
and into each cell we place 2 electrons with opposing spins. We always add the electrons to the lowest open energy level, and repeat the process until we have added all $N$ electrons. This procedure is represented by the equation
\begin{equation}
	N = \frac{2}{h^{3}}\int_{V}\dif^{3}x\int_{0}^{\EF}\dif^{3}p
\end{equation}
In this equation $\EF$, the \emph{Fermi energy}, is the energy of the last electrons added and is the largest filled energy level.

If our volume is isotropic, then we can change variables: first, to spherical momentum coordinates, $\dif^{3}p = 4\pi p^{2}\,\dif p$; second, from $\dif p$ to $\dif\varepsilon$.  Since $p = \sqrt{2m\varepsilon}$, where $\varepsilon$ is the energy of a single electron,
\[
	\dif p = \sqrt{\frac{m}{2\varepsilon}}\,\dif \varepsilon;
\]
we can therefore change variables and integrate over $\varepsilon$ from $0$ to $\EF$ to obtain
\[
	N = \frac{8\pi}{h^{3}}V \int_{0}^{\EF} \sqrt{2}m^{3/2}\varepsilon^{1/2}\,\dif \varepsilon
	= \frac{8\pi}{3h^{3}} V (2m)^{3/2} \EF^{3/2}.
\]
Solving for the Fermi energy gives
\begin{equation}\label{e.fermi-energy}
	\EF = \frac{h^{2}}{2m}\left(\frac{3}{8\pi}\frac{N}{V}\right)^{2/3}.
\end{equation}
What is the total energy of our system? We again integrate over phase space, with each electron multiplied by its energy $\varepsilon$:
\begin{equation}\label{e.total-energy}
	E = \frac{8\pi}{h^{3}}V\int_{0}^{\EF}\sqrt{2}m^{3/2}\varepsilon^{3/2}\,\dif\varepsilon = \frac{8\pi}{5h^{3}}V(2m)^{3/2} \EF^{5/2}.
\end{equation}
Using eq.~(\ref{e.fermi-energy}) to substitute for $\EF$ in eq.~(\ref{e.total-energy}), we can find the energy per unit volume,
\[
	\frac{E}{V} = \frac{3}{5}\left(\frac{3}{8\pi}\right)^{2/3}\frac{h^{2}}{2m}n^{5/3} = \frac{3}{5} n \EF,
\]
where $n=N/V$ is the density of electrons.

Recall that for a non-relativistic gas the pressure is $P = (2/3)(E/V)$.  Hence the pressure of our electron gas is
\begin{equation}\label{e.pressure-electrons}
	P = \frac{2}{3}\frac{E}{V} = \frac{2}{5} n\EF
		= \frac{2}{5}\left(\frac{3}{8\pi}\right)^{2/3}\frac{h^{2}}{2m}n^{5/3}.
\end{equation}
Notice that the pressure is independent of the temperature.

The electrons, being more than 1000 times lighter than the nuclei, become degenerate first. Suppose our composition consists of species with charge $Z_{i}$ and mass number $A_{i}$. Then the number of electrons per unit volume\marginnote{assuming complete ionizaton} is
\[
	n_{e} = \sum_{i} n_{i} Z_{i} = \frac{\rho}{\mb}\sum_{i} X_{i}\frac{Z_{i}}{A_{i}}.
\]
By analogy with the mean molecular weight, we define an electron mean weight
\begin{equation}\label{e.electron-mean-weight}
\mu_{e} \equiv \left(\sum_{i}X_{i}\frac{Z_{i}}{A_{i}}\right)^{-1}
\end{equation}
so that $n_{e} = \rho/(\mb\mu_{e})$.

\begin{exercisebox}[The mass-radius relation for a degenerate EOS]
\label{ex.degenerate-mass-radius}
Use equation~(\ref{e.electron-mean-weight}) in eq.~(\ref{e.pressure-electrons}) to express the pressure as a function of mass density $\rho$. The use the virial scalings for $P(M,R)$ and $\rho(M,R)$ to obtain a relation $R(M)$ for a degenerate object. \emph{Hint:} this may be easier to do numerically, e.g., within a Jupyter notebook.
\end{exercisebox}

As you found in exercise~\ref{ex.degenerate-mass-radius}, when the star becomes degenerate, there is a unique radius for a given mass and composition. This is in contrast to the non-degenerate case, for which a star of a given mass can have a wide range of possible radii depending on the internal temperature.

Let's apply this to a contracting pre-main-sequence star. Initially, the star is at low density and the equation of state is that of an ideal non-degenerate gas. According to the virial theorem, as the radius decreases, both the central temperature and density increase. 
The radius decreases because the star is radiating away energy, and a star with an ideal, non-degenerate equation of state has a total energy that depends on its radius.

At some density, the equation of state will become degenerate. At this point, contraction comes to a halt. The star continues to radiate energy, but instead of contracting, the star simply cools while remaining at constant radius. If the contracting pre-main-sequence star to become a main-sequence star, then, it much reach temperatures sufficient for hydrogen fusion to occur \emph{before} becoming degenerate.

\begin{exercisebox}[Minimum stellar mass]
\label{ex.minimum-stellar-mass}
The equation of state becomes degenerate roughly where $\kB T=\EF$, with $\EF$ begin given by eq.~(\ref{e.fermi-energy}). From this and eq.~(\ref{e.electron-mean-weight}), assuming a H-He composition with $X_{\mathrm{H}} = 0.7$ and $X_{\mathrm{He}}=0.3$, derive a relation between $\log(T)$ and $\log(\rho)$. Plot this relation on the phase diagram in exercise~\ref{ex.contraction-to-main-sequence}, and on the plot indicate which side of the relation is degenerate.
Given that contraction halts when the equation of state becomes degenerate, what does this plot imply for the minimum mass required to initiate hydrogen fusion?
\end{exercisebox}

\subsection{Radiation pressure}
\label{s.radiation-pressure}

Radiation in thermal equilibrium exerts a pressure (eq.~\ref{e.radiation-pressure}): $\Prad = aT^{4}/3$. Because the pressure goes as $T^{4}$, radiation pressure becomes an increasingly large fraction of the total pressure for massive stars. Stars that are radiation-pressure dominated tend to be unstable: they have strong winds and violent fits of mass ejection (see the image of Eta Carinae, Fig.~\ref{f.eta-carinae}). As a result, they lose copious amounts of mass while on the main sequence.

\begin{exercisebox}[Radiation pressure]
Use the virial relations for density and temperature to estimate how the ratio $\Prad/P_{\!\mathrm{gas}}$ depends on the mass of the star.
\end{exercisebox}

\begin{exercisebox}[Maximum stellar mass]
\label{ex.maximum-stellar-mass}
The equation of state becomes dominated by radiation roughly where $P(\textrm{ideal gas}) \approx P(\textrm{radiation})$. Derive from this criterion a relation between $\log(T)$ and $\log(\rho)$, and plot this relation on the figure for exercise~\ref{ex.contraction-to-main-sequence}. Indicate which side of this relation is radiation-pressure dominated. What do your findings in this exercise imply for the mass range of main-sequence stars?
\end{exercisebox}

\section{Life on the main-sequence}

The strong temperature dependence of the CNO burning has two effects on the structure of the star. First, it makes the central temperature nearly constant over a wide range of stellar masses for $M > \val{1}{\Msun}$. A constant central temperature implies, via the virial theorem, that $R \propto M$ on the upper main sequence. A second consequence is that nearly all of the star's luminosity is generated in a small mass about the stellar center.

This convective zone changes the structure of the star, so that $L\sim M^{3.5}$ rather than the $M^{3}$ scaling we derived earlier.  It also means the star can burn more of the hydrogen in its interior.  The hotter $\Teff$ means, however, that the opacity is less strong in the surface layers of upper main sequence stars, and so the outer layers are radiative.  

%Table~\ref{t.MS-characteristics} gives a summary of the properties of main sequence stars.
