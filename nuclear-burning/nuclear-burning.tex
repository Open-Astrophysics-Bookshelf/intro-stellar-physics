\section{The nucleus}

Experimentally, nuclei are on the order of femtometers\sidenote{Sometimes called a \emph{Fermi}} ($\val{1}{\fermi} = \val{10^{-15}}{\meter}$) in size. Like an atom, the nucleus also has excited states; typical energies for these are on the order of MeV ($\val{1}{\MeV} = \val{10^{6}}{\eV}$). \marginnote{An \newterm{electron volt} (eV) is the energy acquired by an electron being accelerated through a potential difference of 1 volt.} It therefore makes sense to use fm and MeV as our units of length and energy. In these units, the combination
\[	\hbar c = \val{197}{\MeV\,\fermi} \]
to three significant figures. In quantum field theory, the strength of the electromagnetic interaction is characterized by the dimensionless constant
\[	\alphaF = \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}\hbar c} = \frac{1}{137}, \]
again to three significant figures. From these two quantities, we find the electron (or proton) charge in these units,
\[
	\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} = \alphaF\hbar c = \val{1.44}{\MeV\,\fermi}.
\]
Put another way, the potential energy between two protons of charge $e$ separated by $\val{1}{\fermi}$ is $\val{1.44}{\MeV}$.

The strong nuclear force differs from electromagnetism and gravity in that it is short-range: the interaction vanishes for distances $\gtrsim\val{2}{\fermi}$. It is weakly attractive for distances $\val{1}{\fermi}\lesssim r\lesssim\val{2}{\fermi}$ and becomes strongly repulsive at distances $\ll\val{1}{\fermi}$. The potential between the neutron and proton in a deuterium (\hydrogen[2]) nucleus (called a deuteron) must therefore look something like that in Fig.~\ref{f.nuclear-potential}. The deuteron's ground state (black dotted line) is at $E_{d} = -\val{2.2}{\MeV}$, so the nucleus is weakly bound ($|E_{d}| \ll |V|$, where $V$ is the depth of the potential well).

\begin{marginfigure}[-8\baselineskip]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{nuclear-potential}
\caption[Schematic of the nuclear potential]{\label{f.nuclear-potential}Schematic of the nuclear potential for a deuteron (\hydrogen[2]). The binding energy of the deuteron is shown as a black dotted line.}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{exercisebox}[Depth of nuclear well]
We can estimate the depth of the well in Fig.~\ref{f.nuclear-potential}. Since this is a two-body problem, transfer to center-of-mass coordinates and treat this as a single particle with a reduced mass $m_{p}m_{n}/(m_{p}+m_{n}) \approx m_{n}/2$. Use the uncertainty principle, with $\Delta x$ being the width of the well, to get an estimate of $p\sim\Delta p$ and from this estimate the kinetic energy of the particle. Finally, use the small value of the binding energy (sum of potential and kinetic) to construct an estimate for the depth of the potential well.
\end{exercisebox}

Unlike electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force does not obey superposition: we cannot write the energy of the nucleus as a sum over the potential between all pairs of nucleons. Moreover, the strong nuclear force is not a central force, meaning that it depends on more than just the distance between any two nucleons. The behavior of an atomic nucleus is thus much more complicated to describe than the electronic structure of the atom.

\newthought{Despite these complications, there are many properties of the nucleus that we can deduce.} Let us write the mass of a nucleus with $A$ nucleons---$Z$ protons and $N=A-Z$ neutrons---as
\[
	M(Z,N) = Zm_{p} + Nm_{n} - B(Z,N)/c^{2},
\]
where $B(Z,N)$ is the \newterm{binding energy}---the amount of energy that must be supplied to the nucleus in order to break it into its constituent protons and neutrons.

Because the nuclear force is weakly attractive for separations  and repulsive at shorter distances (Fig.~\ref{f.nuclear-potential}), there is a characteristic distance between nucleons that is a bit larger than $\val{1}{\fermi}$. In a large nucleus, we therefore expect the nucleons to have a roughly constant density, so that the volume of the nucleus is proportional to $A$; experimentally, the radius of the nucleus is roughly\sidenote{The value of the radius depends somewhat on how it is measured; these values come from scattering with various light particles (protons, neutrons, alpha, electrons).}
\[
	r_{A} = \valrng{1.1}{1.8}{\fermi}\times A^{1/3}.
\]
Notice that because the nucleon-nucleon potential is short-ranged, nucleons in a large nucleus only interact with their nearest neighbors. Indeed the nucleon-nucleon interaction in similar in form to the potential between molecules in a fluid, such as a water drop. This motivates developing a simple formula that gives a decent approximation for the binding energy. For the first term, we estimate the binding energy of a large nucleus as the binding energy of a single nucleon with its neighbors, multiplied by the number of nucleons. Experimentally, it is found that for large nuclei this is the case: the binding energy per nucleon is roughly constant: we say that the nuclear interaction \newterm{saturates}.

\begin{exercisebox}[If the strong force were long-range]
To see how the nuclear force differs from the long-range Coulomb and gravitational force, suppose instead that the nuclear force acted like a super-gravity. Use the results from our constant-density model of a star (eq.~[\ref{e.energy-constant-density-sphere}]) to derive how the binding energy would scale with $A$ in this case.
\end{exercisebox}

It is energetically favorable to have equal numbers of neutrons and protons. We therefore define an asymmetry parameter $\eta \equiv (N-Z)/(N+Z) = 1-2Z/A$, so that $-1\le\eta\le1$. The binding energy is maximum for $\eta = 0$; because the nuclear force does not distinguish between neutrons and protons, the binding energy is quadratic in $\eta$. Thus our first approximation for the binding energy is $B \approx (a_{V} - a_{A}\eta^{2}) A$. Here $a_{V}$ and $a_{A}$ are as-yet-undetermined coefficients.

In a fluid drop there is a correction for the surface tension. Heuristically, we imagine that nuclei in the surface have fewer neighbors and are therefore not as bound. We therefore subtract from our formula a term proportional to the surface area, $\propto r_{A}^{2} \propto A^{2/3}$. The next iteration of our liquid-drop approximation is thus $B \approx (a_{V}- a_{A}\eta^{2})A - a_{S}A^{2/3} $. Finally, the protons in the nucleus repel one another and this repulsion also reduces the binding energy. We therefore subtract a term $\propto Z^{2}/r_{A}\propto Z^{2}/A^{1/3}$ from our mass formula to obtain
\begin{equation}\label{e.liquid-drop}
B = \left(a_{V} -a_{A}\eta^{2}\right) A -  a_{S}A^{2/3} - a_{C} \frac{Z^{2}}{A^{1/3}}. 
\end{equation}
This is a version of the \newterm{semi-empirical mass formula}, also known as the \newterm{Bethe-Weizs\"acker mass formula}.
The coefficients $a_{V},a_{A},a_{S},a_{C}$ are found by fitting the formula to known nuclear masses\sidenote{This fit should have another term to account for the pairing of neutrons and protons, so that the binding energy is  increased for even $Z$ and $N$. We omit that term here for simplicity.}
for measured nuclear masses (Table~\ref{t.liquid-drop}).

\begin{exercisebox}[The nuclear landscape]
For a given nuclear mass number $A$, derive an expression for the charge number $Z_{\star}(A)$ that maximizes the binding energy (eq.~[\ref{e.liquid-drop}] with coefficients from Table~\ref{t.liquid-drop}).
\begin{enumerate}
\item Plot the ratio $Z_{\star}/A$ for $4\le A\le 128$. Give a physical explanation for the behavior of $Z_{\star}/A$.
\item Plot the binding energy per nucleon $B/A$ as a function of $Z_{\star}$ and $A$, for $4\le A\le 128$.
\item Find the atomic number $Z$ and atomic mass $A$ of the nucleus with the maximum $B/A$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercisebox}

\section{The Coulomb barrier}

Let's take two nuclei with masses\sidenote{When doing kinematics, we shall make the approximation $m\approx A\mb$.} $A_{1}\mb$ and $A_{2}\mb$. This is a two-body problem, so we transform to the center-of-mass frame; the problem reduces to that of one particle, mass $A\mb = A_{1}A_{2}/(A_{1}+A_{2})\times\mb$, moving in a potential.  At distances $\gtrsim \val{2}{\fermi}$, the potential is all Coulomb\sidenote{We write the force between two electrons as $e^2/r^2$.},
\[ \frac{Z_{1}Z_{2}e^{2}}{r} = \val{1.44}{\MeV}\times Z_{1}Z_{2}\left(\frac{\val{1}{\fermi}}{r}\right). \]
We show in Fig.~\ref{f.tunneling} this Coulomb potential as a red curve.
At closer distances the nuclear potential forms a deep well with a repulsive core (blue curve in Fig.~\ref{f.tunneling}).

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{tunnel-schematic}
\caption{Tunneling through the Coulomb potential barrier.}
\label{f.tunneling}
\end{marginfigure}

\newthought{Suppose we shoot the particle in from infinity:} How close does the particle come before stopping? For the sun, $E \sim \val{1}{\keV}$ (black line in Fig.~\ref{f.tunneling}).  Equating this energy with the potential and solving for $r$ gives the \emph{turning radius}
\begin{equation}
	r_{E} = \frac{Z_{1}Z_{2}e^{2}}{E} = Z_{1}Z_{2}\times \left(\frac{\val{1}{\keV}}{E}\right) \times \val{1440}{\fermi}.
\end{equation}
This is much bigger than the nuclear radius.  Classically the particle can't go in the region $r<r_{E}$.

The world is quantum, however: the particle wavefunction (thin gray line) decreases exponentially in this region, but there is a finite probability for the particle to reach $r\sim\val{1}{\fermi}$.  This probability is
\[ \mathcal{P}\approx \exp\left[-2\pi^{2}\frac{r_{E}}{\lambda}\right] \]
where $\lambda = h/p$, $p$ being the momentum of the particle.

Expanding,
\[ \frac{2\pi^{2}r_{E}}{\lambda} = 2\pi^{2}\left(\frac{Z_{1}Z_{2}e^{2}}{E}\right)
	\left(\frac{p}{h}\right) = \left[\sqrt{2}\pi \frac{Z_{1}Z_{2}e^{2}}{\hbar}\right]\left(\frac{1}{E}\right)^{1/2}, \]
so we write
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P} \approx \exp\left[-\left(\frac{\EG}{E}\right)^{1/2}\right],
\end{equation}
with
\[ \EG \equiv \textrm{``Gamow Energy''} = \left[\frac{2\pi^{2}Z_{1}Z_{2}e^{4}m}{\hbar^{2}}\right] = Z_{1}^{2}Z_{2}^{2}A \times \val{979}{\keV}.
\]

\section{The cross-section}
The cross-section for scattering in general is proportional to the ``size'' of the wavefunction, 
\[\sigma\propto \pi\left(\frac{\lambda}{2\pi}\right)^{2} = \pi \left(\frac{\hbar}{p}\right)^{2} = \pi\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2mE}.\]
To get the cross-section for a reaction, we multiply this by the probability of tunneling through the Coulomb barrier, $\mathcal{P} = \exp\left[-\left(\EG/E\right)^{1/2}\right]$, and a term $S(E)$ that accounts for the nuclear interaction.

Putting this all together, we write the reaction cross-section as
\begin{equation}\label{e.s-def}
\sigma(E) = \frac{S(E)}{E}\exp\left[-\left(\frac{\EG}{E}\right)\right].
\end{equation}
For many reactions that $S(E)$ is nearly constant,
%\sidenote{This is true as long as we are not close to a resonance---an energy level in the compound nucleus that matches the energy of the incoming particle.}
which helps with extrapolating the cross-section from laboratory energies  to the much lower stellar energies.

\section{The reaction rate}
Recall that the mean-free path of a particle is $\ell = (n\sigma)^{-1}$, where $n$ is the density of targets.  For a particle traveling at speed $v$, the mean time between collisions is therefore $\ell/v$; in a large ensemble of particles, this gives the mean rate, $r = n\sigma v$.  Here $v = |\bvec{v}_{1}-\bvec{v}_{2}|$ is the relative velocity between the particles.  Since the cross-section depends on energy, the rate at which any given particle 1 will react with particles of type 2 having velocities $\bvec{v}_{2}$ in a range $\dif^{3}v_{2}$ is
\[ n_{2} \sigma |\bvec{v}_{1}-\bvec{v}_{2}| \left(\frac{m_{2}}{2\pi kT}\right)^{3/2}\exp\left(-\frac{m_{2}v_{2}^{2}}{2kT}\right) \,\dif^{3}v_{2}. \]
The extra terms are because the particles have a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of velocities.  To get the total rate per unit volume, we then have to multiply by the number of particles of type 1 having velocities $\bvec{v}_{1}$ in a range $\dif^{3} v_{1}$ and integrate\sidenote{If particle 1 and particle 2 are identical, for example in the reaction $p+p$, then divide the rate by 2 to avoid double-counting.} over $\dif^{3}v_{1}\,\dif^{3}v_{2}$:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{e.rate-joint}
\lefteqn{r_{12} = n_{1}n_{2}  \left[\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{(2\pi kT)^{2}}\right]^{3/2}}
  \nonumber\\ &&\times\int\! \sigma(E) v\exp\left(-\frac{m_{1}v_{1}^{2}}{2kT}-\frac{m_{2}v_{2}^{2}}{2kT}\right)  \,\dif^{3} v_{1}\,\dif^{3}v_{2}.
\end{eqnarray}
Now $E$ and $v$ are the relative energies and velocity in the center-of-mass frame.  We can change variable using the relations
\begin{eqnarray*}
\bvec{v}_{1} &=& \bvec{V} - \frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} \bvec{v}\\
\bvec{v}_{2} &=& \bvec{V} + \frac{m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} \bvec{v}.
\end{eqnarray*}
where $V$ is the center-of-mass velocity. It is straightforward to show that $\dif v_{1,x}\,\dif v_{2,x} = \dif V_{x}\dif v_{x}$, and likewise for the $y,z$ directions.  Furthermore, $m_{1}v_{1}^{2} + m_{2}v_{2}^{2} = (m_{1}+m_{2})V^{2} + m v^{2}$, and multiplying and dividing the integral in equation~(\ref{e.rate-joint}) by $m_{1}+m_{2}$ allows us to write
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lefteqn{r_{12} = n_{1}n_{2} \left(\frac{m_{1}+m_{2}}{2kT}\right)^{3/2}\left(\frac{m}{2kT}\right)^{3/2}}\\
&&\times \int\!\dif^{3}V \int\!\dif^{3}v \,\sigma(E)v \exp\left[-\frac{mv^{2}}{2kT}\right]
 \exp\left[-\frac{(m_{1}+m_{2})V^{2}}{2kT}\right].
\end{eqnarray*}
The integral over $\dif^{3}V$ can be factored out and is normalized to unity. Hence we have for the reaction rate between a pair of particles 1 and 2, 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{e.rate}
r_{12} &=& n_{1}n_{2}\left\{\left(\frac{m}{2\pi kT}\right)^{3/2}\int_{0}^{\infty}\! \sigma(E) v \exp\left(-\frac{mv^{2}}{2kT}\right)  4\pi v^{2}\,\dif v\right\}.\nonumber\\
 &\equiv& \frac{1}{1+\delta_{12}}n_{1}n_{2}\langle\sigma v\rangle.
\end{eqnarray}
The term in $\{\}$ is the averaging over the joint distribution of the cross-section times the velocity, and is usually denoted as $\langle\sigma v\rangle$. 

Changing variables to $E = mv^{2}/2$ in equation~(\ref{e.rate}) and inserting the formula for the cross-section, equation~(\ref{e.s-def}), gives
\begin{equation}\label{e.integral}
\langle\sigma v\rangle = \left(\frac{8}{\pi m}\right)^{1/2}\left(\frac{1}{kT}\right)^{3/2}\int_{0}^{\infty}\!S(E)\exp\left[-\left(\frac{\EG}{E}\right)^{1/2}-\frac{E}{kT}\right]\,\dif E.
\end{equation}
Now, we've assumed that $S(E)$ varies slowly; but look at the argument of the exponential. This is a competition between a rapidly rising term $\exp[-(\EG/E)^{1/2}]$ and a rapidly falling term $\exp(-E/kT)$. As a result, the exponential will have a strong peak, and we can expand the integrand in a Taylor series about the maximum. Let 
\[
f(E) = -\left(\frac{\EG}{E}\right)^{1/2} - \frac{E}{kT}.
\]
Then we can write 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lefteqn{\int_{0}^{\infty}\!S(E)\exp\left[-\left(\frac{\EG}{E}\right)^{1/2}-\frac{E}{kT}\right]\,\dif E}\\
&\approx&
	\int_{0}^{\infty}\! S(\Epk)\exp\left[f(\Epk) + \frac{1}{2}\left.\frac{\dif^{2} f}{\dif E^{2}}\right|_{E=\Epk}\left(E-\Epk\right)^{2}\right].
\end{eqnarray*}
Here $\Epk$ is found by solving $(\dif f/\dif E)|_{E=\Epk} = 0$. This trick allows us to turn the integral into a Gaussian! (Before the internet, all there was to do for fun were integrals.)

Solving for \Epk, we get
\[
\Epk = \frac{\EG^{1/3}(kT)^{2/3}}{2^{2/3}},
\]
and 
\[ \exp\left[f(\Epk)\right] = \exp\left[-3\left(\frac{\EG}{4kT}\right)^{1/3}\right].
\]
Further,
\[
\left.\frac{1}{2}\frac{\dif^{2}f}{\dif E^{2}}\right|_{E=\Epk} = -\frac{3}{2(2\EG)^{1/3}(kT)^{5/3}} = -\frac{3}{4\Epk kT}.
\]
Defining a variable $\Delta = 4(\Epk kT/3)^{1/2}$, our integral becomes
\begin{eqnarray}\label{e.integral2}
\lefteqn{\langle\sigma v\rangle = \left(\frac{8}{\pi m}\right)^{1/2}\left(\frac{1}{kT}\right)^{3/2}}\nonumber\\
&&\times S(\Epk)
  \exp\left[-3\left(\frac{\EG}{4kT}\right)^{1/3}\right]
  \int_{0}^{\infty}\!\exp\left[-\frac{(E-\Epk)^{2}}{(\Delta/2)^{2}}\right]\,\dif E.
\end{eqnarray}
How well does this approximation do?  Figure~\ref{f.integrand} shows the integrand (\emph{solid line}) and the approximation by a Gaussian (\emph{dashed line}).  Although the integrand is skewed to the right, the area is approximately the same.  
\begin{marginfigure}[-16\baselineskip]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{coulomb_integrand}
\caption[Terms in integrand for calculating Coulomb barrier]{Integrand of eq.~(\protect\ref{e.integral}) (\emph{solid line}) and the Gaussian (\emph{dot-dashed line}) constructed by expanding to second order the argument of the exponential. The parameters for $\EG$ were taken from the $p+p$ reactions ($Z_{1}Z_{2}=1$, $A = 1/2$), and the temperature is $\val{10^{7}}{\K}$.  Note that the grey curves, showing the two terms of the exponential, have been rescaled to fit on the same plot.}
\label{f.integrand}
\end{marginfigure}

Another simplification can be made because both the Gaussian and the original integrand go to zero as $E\to 0$.  As a result, we can extend the lower bound of our integral (eq.~[\ref{e.integral2}]) to $-\infty$, and obtain
\begin{eqnarray}\label{e.rate2}
\langle\sigma v\rangle &\approx& \left(\frac{8}{\pi m}\right)^{1/2}\left(\frac{1}{kT}\right)^{3/2} S(\Epk) \exp\left[-3\left(\frac{\EG}{4kT}\right)^{1/3}\right]\frac{\Delta}{2}\nonumber\\
 &=& \frac{2^{13/6}}{\sqrt{3m}}\frac{\EG^{1/6}}{(kT)^{2/3}} \exp\left[-3\left(\frac{\EG}{4kT}\right)^{1/3}\right]  S(\Epk).
\end{eqnarray}
On to some numbers. Table~\ref{t.reaction} lists quantities for some common reactions. A couple of notes. First, $\Delta/\Epk$ indicates how well our Gaussian approximation works---you will see it is less than 1 in all cases. We evaluated $\Delta/\Epk$, which decreases with temperature as $T^{-1/6}$, at $T = \val{10^{7}}{\K}$. Second, the quantity $n(T)$ is the exponent if we want to approximate the reaction rate as a power-law, $r\propto T^{n}$.  We compute this as 
\begin{equation}\label{e.exponent}
 n(T) = \dd{\ln r}{\ln T} = -\frac{2}{3} + \left(\frac{\EG}{4kT}\right)^{1/3},
\end{equation}
as you can verify for yourself. In the table, the exponent is evaluated at $T = \val{10^{7}}{\K}$; the exponent $n$ depends on temperature. Finally, note the size of $\EG/(4k)$.  This makes the argument of the exponential in equation~(\ref{e.rate2}) large in absolute value, and sets the temperature scale at which a given reaction comes into play.
