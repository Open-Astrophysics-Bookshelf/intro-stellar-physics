\section*{Preface}
These notes were compiled when I taught the junior/senior undergraduate course on stars at Michigan State University in the autumns of 2012, 2014, and 2016, and were typeset, with additional figures and exercises, during sprint and summer of 2018. The motivation for typesetting the notes was twofold: first, I was already providing many supplemental handouts and exercises for the students, so it made sense to compile them; second, the reduced reliance on a textbook made it difficult to justify the additional cost.

The text layout uses the \code{tufte-book} (\url{https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/}) \LaTeX\ class: the main feature is a large outer margin in which the students can take notes; this margin also holds small figures and footnotes. Exercises are embedded throughout the text. The exercises range from comprehension checks to longer, more challenging problems.  Because the exercises are spread throughout the text, there is a ``List of Exercises'' in the front matter to help with looking for specific problems. I've also added boxes containing more advanced material that I felt students should be exposed to, but were not essential to the main development of the course. The design is meant to encourage students to actively work through the notes, and it will be interesting to see if that occurs.

To liven up the chapter titles, I used song names. The first two were easy; my rules for the following chapters were that the song had to make sense, both with the content and it had to musically match the ones already in the list (that is, they would make sense being on a single playlist). The credits, in order, go to Muse; Queen/David Bowie; Greta van Fleek; Dio; Deep Purple; David Bowie; and the Traveling Wilburys.
