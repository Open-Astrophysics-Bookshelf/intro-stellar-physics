\section*{Preface}
These notes were compiled when I taught the junior/senior undergraduate course on stars at Michigan State University in the autumns of 2012, 2014, and 2016, and were put into manuscript, with additional figures and exercises, during spring and summer of 2018. The motivation for doing so was twofold: first, I was already providing many supplemental handouts and exercises for the students, so it made sense to compile them; second, the high cost of a (lightly used) textbook makes the cheap distribution of notes an attractive option.

The text layout uses the \code{tufte-book} (\url{https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/}) \LaTeX\ class: the main feature is a large outer margin in which the students can take notes; this margin also holds small figures and footnotes. Exercises are embedded throughout the text. The exercises range from comprehension checks to longer, more challenging problems. This layout is meant to encourage students to actively work through the notes, and it will be interesting to see if that in fact occurs. Because the exercises are spread throughout the text, there is a ``List of Exercises'' in the front. I've also added boxes containing more advanced material that I felt students should be exposed to, but were not essential to the main development of the course. 

A second goal of the course was to train students to ``think like a physicist:'' by which I mean, to physical concepts to analyze the behavior of macroscopic objects, such as stars. Many of the problems, therefore, make use of simplified models or dimensional analysis rather than elaborate calculation. 

To liven up the chapter titles, I used song names. The first two were easy; in selecting titles for the other chapters, I required that the new song title had to have a similar style with the ones already in the list. The song title credits, in order, go to Muse, Queen/David Bowie, Greta van Fleek, Dio, Deep Purple, David Bowie, and the Traveling Wilburys.
